\section*{Introduction}

The goal of symbolic regression is to be able, from a set of couples (x,f(x)) for a certain function to f,
to recover the expression of f.

This can be very useful to know the formula of a certain physic quantity from a set of experimental measurements.

\section{The Symbolic Regression Algorithm}

\section{A neural network to help with the symbolic regression algorithm}

The process mentionned just above can be pretty slow, so it can be useful to give it guidance, by telling it which
formula tokens are likely or not to be in the final formula. And a deep neural network seems very appropriate to do this.
